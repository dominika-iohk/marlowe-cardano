    -- There are two reasons why this is stored in the `Env` rather than the Contract.State:
    -- 1. There are multiple Contract.State (one per each contract) but only one carousel at a time.
    --    Sharing the subscription makes sense in that regard.
    -- 2. We need to be inside the Effect/Aff monad in order to create an AVar, and most of the state
    --    creation functions didn't require that, so it seemed wrong to lift several functions into Effect.
    --    In contrast, the Env is created in Main, where we already have access to Effect
